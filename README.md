<h3>Description</h3>
Patients with Liver disease have been continuously increasing because of excessive consumption of alcohol, inhale of harmful gases, intake of contaminated food, pickles and drugs. This dataset was used to evaluate prediction algorithms in an effort to reduce burden on doctors.

Columns:

Age of the patient

Gender of the patient

Total Bilirubin
  Bilirubin is an orange-yellow pigment that occurs normally when part of your red blood cells break down.
 A bilirubin test measures the amount of bilirubin in your blood. It’s used to help find the cause of health conditions like jaundice, anemia, and liver disease.

Direct Bilirubin
  Bilirubin attached by the liver to glucuronic acid, a glucose-derived acid, is called direct, or conjugated, bilirubin. Bilirubin not attached to glucuronic acid is called indirect

Alkaline Phosphotase
  Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme in a person's blood that helps break down proteins.Using an ALP test, it is possible to measure how much of this enzyme is circulating in a person’s blood.

Alamine Aminotransferase
  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is an enzyme found primarily in the liver and kidney.   ALT is increased with liver damage and is used to screen for and/or monitor liver disease. 

Aspartate Aminotransferase
  AST (aspartate aminotransferase) is an enzyme that is found mostly in the liver, but also in muscles. When your liver is damaged, it releases AST into your bloodstream. An AST blood test measures the amount of AST in your blood. The test can help your health care provider diagnose liver damage or disease.

Total Protiens
  Albumin and globulin are two types of protein in your body. The total protein test measures the total amount albumin and globulin in your body.
