# LiverGuard
<h3>Description</h3>
Patients with Liver disease have been continuously increasing because of excessive consumption of alcohol, inhaling of harmful gases, intake of contaminated food, pickles, and drugs. This dataset was used to evaluate prediction algorithms to reduce the burden on doctors.
<h3>
Content</h3>
This data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 nonliver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The "Dataset" column is a class label used to divide groups into the liver patient (liver disease) or not (no disease). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.
<h3>
Data Description</h3>
Any patient's age exceeds 89 is listed as "90".

<h3>Columns:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Age of the patient</li>

<li>Gender of the patient</li>

<li>Total Bilirubin</li>: Bilirubin is an orange-yellow pigment that occurs normally when part of your red blood cells break down.
 A bilirubin test measures the amount of bilirubin in your blood. It’s used to help find the cause of health conditions like jaundice, anemia, and liver disease.

<li>Direct Bilirubin</li>: Bilirubin attached by the liver to glucuronic acid, a glucose-derived acid, is called direct, or conjugated, bilirubin. Bilirubin not attached to glucuronic acid is called an indirect.

<li>Alkaline Phosphatase</li>: Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme in a person's blood that helps break down proteins. Using an ALP test, it is possible to measure how much of this enzyme is circulating in a person’s blood.

<li>Alamine Aminotransferase</li>: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is an enzyme found primarily in the liver and kidney.   ALT is increased with liver damage and is used to screen for and monitor liver disease. 

<li>Aspartate Aminotransferase</li>: AST (aspartate aminotransferase) is an enzyme that is found mostly in the liver, but also muscles. When your liver is damaged, it releases AST into your bloodstream. An AST blood test measures the amount of AST in your blood. The test can help your healthcare provider diagnose liver damage or disease.

<li>Total Protiens</li>: Albumin and globulin are two types of protein in your body. The total protein test measures the total albumin and globulin in your body. 

<li>Albumin and Globulin Ratio</li>

<li>Dataset</li>: field used to split the data into two sets (patient with liver disease, or no disease)
</ul>
